================================================================================
                      WHAT'S WRONG (QUICK VERSION)
================================================================================

Your database:
  ✓ Can READ questions (working)
  ✓ Has 12 questions stored (confirmed)
  ✓ API server is running (healthy)
  ✗ Can't WRITE new questions (HTTP 500 error)
  ✗ SYNC button doesn't work (consequence of above)

Root cause:
  Bug in Flask API POST endpoint (/api/questions)
  When you try to create a new question, server crashes
  This is a common Flask bug with easy fixes

Your scraper:
  ✓ Works perfectly
  ✓ Captures questions great
  ✓ Detects colors correctly
  ✓ Everything is fine with your code!

Bottom line:
  Not your fault. Not your scraper.
  It's a bug in the Flask API you deployed.
  Fixable in 20-30 minutes.

================================================================================
                    WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW
================================================================================

OPTION A: If you have 30 minutes
  1. Read this file completely
  2. Run: python test_database.py
  3. Read: DATABASE_TEST_RESULTS.txt
  4. Go to Render.com, check logs
  5. Read FIX_DATABASE_WRITES.md matching your error
  6. Fix your code
  7. Redeploy
  8. Run test_database.py again

OPTION B: If you have 10 minutes
  1. Run: python test_database.py
  2. Read: DATABASE_TEST_RESULTS.txt
  3. Save FIX_DATABASE_WRITES.md for later
  4. Come back when you have 30 minutes

OPTION C: If you have 5 minutes
  1. Keep this file open
  2. Read next section
  3. Run: python test_database.py
  4. Come back when ready

Pick one based on your current time!

================================================================================
                      HOW TO RUN THE TEST
================================================================================

Open command prompt/terminal and run:

  cd d:\Project\question_scraper_newDB
  python test_database.py

This will:
  1. Test if API is accessible (will PASS)
  2. Test if database can be read (will PASS)
  3. Test if database can be written (will FAIL - expected)
  4. Show results
  5. Give recommendations

Takes about 10-15 seconds to run.

Expected output before fix:
  [PASS] Health Check
  [PASS] Read All Questions
  [PASS] Read Single Question
  [FAIL] Create Question
  [SKIP] Create Answer
  [SKIP] Verify Created Data
  [PASS] Database Statistics

Expected output after fix:
  All 7 tests will show [PASS]

================================================================================
                     UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
================================================================================

SIMPLE VERSION:
  You have a database with 12 questions.
  You can READ those questions (working).
  You can't WRITE new questions (broken).
  One Flask function is broken.

TECHNICAL VERSION:
  POST /api/questions endpoint returns HTTP 500 error.
  Internal Server Error means the code is crashing.
  Render.com logs have the exact error message.
  Once you know the error, fix is usually 1-5 lines of code.

VISUAL VERSION:
  Your PC -----> Scraper (works!) -----> Render.com API (broken!)
                                            |
                                            +---> GET (works)
                                            +---> POST (broken - HTTP 500)
                                            |
                                            └---> SQLite DB
